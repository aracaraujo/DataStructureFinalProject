# DataStructureFinalProject

This tutorial is my final project for CSE 212 â€“ Programming with Data Structures.

I created three tutorials regarding three data structures of my choice. Sets, queues, and Trees.

Each tutorial contain examples and a problem to help the user to practice what was learned.
